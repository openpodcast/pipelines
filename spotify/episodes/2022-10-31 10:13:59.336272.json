(Thanks Media Tech Lab for sponsoring our visit!)Attending the event is a great opportunity to get in touch with the industry and to get a lot of insights into the future of the audio industry.What we found was that the audio industry is going through a massive transformation and that the future of audio is no longer linear.For us this group of people is very interesting, because we want to position Open Podcast as the best tool for gathering analytics for podcasters and podcast studios to help them make this transition.LinksMedientage: conference about media in Munich https://medientage.de/&nbsp;German summary of the conference Medientage https://blog.medientage.de/das-waren-besondere-momente-der-mtm22Our sponsor Media Tech Lab Bayern https://www.media-lab.de/de/media-tech-lab&nbsp;HostsMatthias Endler (https://twitter.com/matthiasendler)&nbsp;Wolfgang Gassler (https://twitter.com/schafele)FeedbackEmail: echo@openpodcast.dev&nbsp;Twitter: https://twitter.com/OpenPodcastDev&nbsp;CreditsThe theme music is U.S. Army Blues - Kelly&rsquo;s Number and is licensed under Public Domain Mark 1.0 License.&nbsp;", "explict": false, "language": "en-US", "duration": 1081677, "starts": 0, "streams": 0, "listeners": 0, "sparkLine": [], "hasVideo": false}, {"name": "#08 - Tech stack: Metabase, Superset, Redash, Grafana", "id": "6oi6r3R5Jl2NqtlJRD1cfn", "url": "https://open.spotify.com/episode/6oi6r3R5Jl2NqtlJRD1cfn", "releaseDate": "2022-10-18", "artworkUrl": "https://i.scdn.co/image/ab6765630000ba8a6523bee5d5b66b94046d859c", "description": "The final part of our tech stack description. This time we discuss the visualization part based on Metabase.For any analytics platform, the decision on how data gets visualized is a crucial one. It is what users will interact with first and has an important impact on how the quality of a data product is perceived. We discuss the pros and cons of the most popular visualization tools and how they compare to Metabase, which is the tool we settled on for Open Podcast.Metabase is a popular open source data visualization tool that integrates well with SQL databases. For our hosted variant of Open Podcast, we use Metabase to visualize the data stored on Planetscale.Before Metabase we used Posthog, which is also great, but doesn't now allow writing custom SQL queries. We also tried Grafana, which is a great tool for time series data, but it also doesn't integrate well with SQL databases and is primarily meant for monitoring solutions.Other competitors we discuss are Superset, Redash, and Grafana.

We think these issues can be fixed with standardization.In this episode we compare the state of podcast analytics with the early days of the web. Back then you had simple image counters on your websites. Pretty limited. The podcast industry is in its infancy as well and the lack of client-side tracking makes it hard for hosts to connect with their audience.We give an overview of the industry efforts to fix these issues and how we&rsquo;re planning to help as well.LinksWolfgang's first online project in the 90s https://web.archive.org/web/19991127092201/http://www.all-4-free.net/counter.htmInteresting resources describing tech behind podcasts  https://openpodcast.dev/#/researchList of podcast user agents https://github.com/opawg/podcast-rss-useragentsIAB guidlines how to measure podcast downloads https://iabtechlab.com/standards/podcast-measurement-guidelines/Tool to process download logs of podcasts https://github.com/open-downloads/odltrivago tech blog https://tech.trivago.comHostsMatthias Endler (https://twitter.com/matthiasendler)&nbsp;Wolfgang Gassler (https://twitter.com/schafele)FeedbackEmail: echo@openpodcast.dev&nbsp;Twitter: https://twitter.com/OpenPodcastDev&nbsp;CreditsThe theme music is U.S. Army Blues - Kelly&rsquo;s Number and is licensed under Public Domain Mark 1.0 License.&nbsp;", "explict": false, "language": "en-US", "duration": 979496, "starts": 1, "streams": 1, "listeners": 1, "sparkLine": [], "hasVideo": false}, {"name": "#04 The Open Podcast API", "id": "7jlcGfznyIdB1PTLteNbmj", "url": "https://open.spotify.com/episode/7jlcGfznyIdB1PTLteNbmj", "releaseDate": "2022-09-20", "artworkUrl": "https://i.scdn.co/image/ab6765630000ba8acb06f112c996ad160a40b991", "description": "In this episode we talk about the Open API for Podcasts project and how you can get involved.Last week we talked about vendor lock-in and how it is a problem for podcasters.We thought it would be a good idea to elaborate on this topic and talk about our proposed solution, an Open API for Podcasts.We talk about the motivation behind the project, what the project is trying to achieve and what the next steps are.

The reason is that Anchor has a non-exclusive license, which means that they can use your content in any way they want, including selling it to third parties. They can also use your content to promote the service, which is a bit of a double edged sword. On the one hand, it's great that they're promoting the service, but on the other hand, they're using your content to do it -- at no additional cost to them.Furthermore, if you want to move your podcast to another platform, you need to update all links in Spotify, Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, etc.As an alternative our Proxy allows you to change the URL transparently and clients won&rsquo;t see a change.In general it's a good idea to do some research before signing up for a hosting and to think about open source platforms which can be hosted on your own and provide statistics which can be exported.LinksAnchor Terms of ServiceOpen Podcast on GithubHostsMatthias Endler (https://twitter.com/matthiasendler)&nbsp;Wolfgang Gassler (https://twitter.com/schafele)FeedbackEmail: echo@openpodcast.dev&nbsp;Twitter: https://twitter.com/OpenPodcastDev&nbsp;CreditsThe theme music is &ldquo;Orbiting A Distant Planet'' by Quantum Jazz and is licensed under a Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 International License.", "explict": false, "language": "en-US", "duration": 519297, "starts": 1, "streams": 1, "listeners": 1, "sparkLine": [], "hasVideo": false}, {"name": "#02 Our Plan - Does Spotify cache podcasts?", "id": "7Im0OmzL44oedpHpBNvA19", "url": "https://open.spotify.com/episode/7Im0OmzL44oedpHpBNvA19", "releaseDate": "2022-09-06", "artworkUrl": "https://i.scdn.co/image/ab6765630000ba8a949a7b5c3456a4599488eb46", "description": "How do podcasts work on a technical level and how do we want to avoid common pitfalls with podcast hosting?Fundamentally podcasts are very simple.

We dive into the pitfalls of hosting podcasts and the advantages of open statistics data for hosts.We will also talk about our plans on how to set up Open Podcast.
